 **Introduction:- I have created a repository on GitHub to organize and share my learning notes on Power BI**

 "The notes cover Power BI basics, data transformation in Power Query, building relationships, DAX fundamentals, and dashboard design principles."
 **I created these notes to document my understanding, help others learn Power BI, and keep a reference for real-world projects**
 "The notes are organized topic-wise, with examples and screenshots wherever necessary to make them easy to follow."
 "I regularly update the repository as I learn new advanced topics like Row-Level Security (RLS) and Power BI Service features."

 I built dashboards using sample datasets like Sales Data and Customer Churn Analysis. 

 **I aim to continue updating this repository as I deepen my understanding of advanced topics and real-world Power BI deployment strategies.
 I believe this habit of documenting and sharing knowledge will help me stay current and contribute more effectively in professional environments**
